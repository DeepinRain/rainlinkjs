There are currently around 140 of these clients available, but a major drawback is that each one only works with a specific lavalink version. While Riffy existed in the past, I found it to be limited in terms of scalability and compatibility with other versions. This is what inspired me to create a lavalink client that can seamlessly integrate with both older and upcoming lavalink versions. I'm excited to introduce this project to everyone - rainlink, also known as rainlink.js!","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.introduction:1.getting-started.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.introduction/1.getting-started.md","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/development/regular-plugin","_dir":"development","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Regular plugin","description":"So you are interested in using Rainlink and want to create your own plugin to extend some of Rainlink's features, so this page can help you somewhat.","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2.development:1.regular-plugin.md","_source":"content","_file":"2.development/1.regular-plugin.md","_extension":"md"}]
