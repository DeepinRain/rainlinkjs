# Library
Are you a developer of the discord api library? Wow, I'm your fan too :0. Or you simply want the library you are using to support rainlink? Well, you can refer to this article.

## Understanding how library implementation works
The way the Library class works is quite similar to [Shoukaku](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shoukaku). So you can absolutely copy from [Shoukaku](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shoukaku) to use in rainlink

## Example:
```ts
import { AbstractLibrary } from 'rainlink';
import { RainlinkNodeOptions } from 'rainlink';

export class OceanicJS extends AbstractLibrary {
	// sendPacket is where your library send packets to Discord Gateway
	public sendPacket(shardId: number, payload: any, important: boolean): void {
		return this.client.shards.get(shardId)?.send(payload.op, payload.d, important);
	}

	// getId is a getter where the lib stores the client user (the one logged in as a bot) id
	public getId(): string {
		return this.client.user.id;
	}

	// Listen attaches the event listener to the library you are using
	public listen(nodes: RainlinkNodeOptions[]): void {
		// Only attach to ready event once, refer to your library for its ready event
		this.client.once('ready', () => this.ready(nodes));
		// Attach to the raw websocket event, this event must be 1:1 on spec with dapi (most libs implement this)
		this.client.on('packet', (packet: any) => this.raw(packet));
	}
}
```
