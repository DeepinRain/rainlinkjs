# Source Resolver Plugin
Want to use any suitable music platform but can't find the official plugin? You can make it yourself right here!

## Understanding how plugin works
Basically, the way it works will be similar to a regular plugin, but it will have stricter conditions so that you can search on lavalink and still be able to fallback to the plugin.

## Requirements
- Using `rainlink` package.
- Extend `SourceRainlinkPlugin` class.
- Class named `RainlinkPlugin`.
- Have `name()` function return the name of that plugin.
- Have `type()` function return the type of that plugin using `RainlinkPluginType` enum. In this article, we will use `sourceResolver`
- Have `load()` function to load all the modded function of that plugin.
- Have `unload()` function to unload all the modded function of that plugin.
- Have `sourceName()` function return the name of that source. (For search from Lavalink, if it now avaliable, you can fill anything you want)
- Have `sourceIdentify()` function return the ID of that source. (For search from Lavalink, if it now avaliable, you can fill anything you want)
