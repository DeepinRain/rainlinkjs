# How to use rainlink?

Here, I will show you how to use rainlink in the simplest way possible.

## Understanding the Structure

At the core of Rainlink is the `Rainlink` class, which serves as the primary interface for interacting with its features. This class encapsulates essential functionalities, including driver, plugin, player and node management, ensuring a cohesive experience for developers. Example of how to init `Rainlink`:

```js
const rainlink = new Rainlink({
  library: new Library.DiscordJS(client),
  nodes: [{
    name: 'owo',
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 2333,
    auth: 'youshallnotpass',
    secure: false,
    // You don't have to add this properties if you're using lavalink v4.
    // About using lavalink v3.7.x, you can change to lavalink@3
    // About using nodelink v2, you can change to nodelink@2
    driver: "lavalink@4"
  }]
});
```

## Player and Node Management

One of the key aspects of Rainlink is its modular approach to player and node management. By dividing responsibilities into distinct classes, such as `RainlinkPlayer` and `NodeManager`, Rainlink enhances clarity and organization within your application.

### Players

Players represent entities responsible for audio playback within a specific context, such as a Discord server. The `RainlinkPlayer` class handles player-related operations, offering functions for retrieving existing players, creating new ones, and accessing player-specific functionalities.

#### Retrieving Players

To retrieve a player associated with a particular Discord server, you can use the `get` method:

```js
<Rainlink>.players.get("myGuildIdDiscord")
```

#### Retrieving Players

To retrieve a player associated with a particular Discord server, you can use the `get` method:

```js
<Rainlink>.players.get("myGuildIdDiscord")
```

#### Creating Players

Creating a new player involves specifying relevant parameters, such as the Discord guild ID, guild shard ID associated voice/text channels:

```js
<Rainlink>.create({
  guildId: "id",
  textId: "voiceId",
  voiceId: "textId",
  shardId: "<your_guild_shard_id>" || 0
})
```

### Node Management

Nodes are essential components in Moonlink responsible for handling audio streams and distributing workload efficiently. The `RainlinkNode` class facilitates node management operations, offering functionalities for adding, retrieving, and removing nodes.

#### Adding Nodes

To add a new node, you can use the `add` method, specifying parameters such as host, password, and port:

```js
<Rainlink>.nodes.add({
  name: "example lavalink", // You can set whatever you want
  host: "example.com",
  password: "securePassword",
  port: 2333,
  auth: "your_lavalink_auth_pasword",
  secure: false, // Set true if your lavalink have ssl
  // You don't have to add this properties if you're using lavalink v4.
  // About using lavalink v3.7.x, you can change to lavalink@3
  // About using nodelink v2, you can change to nodelink@2
  driver: "lavalink@4"
})
```

#### Retrieving Nodes

You can retrieve a node using identifier:

```js
<Rainlink>.nodes.get("example lavalink")
```

#### Removing Nodes

You can remove a node using identifier:

```js
<Rainlink>.nodes.remove("example lavalink")
```

## Understanding Lavalink

Lavalink serves as a simplified audio playback server, functioning as both an API and a WebSocket server for manipulating audio streams. It interfaces with LavaPlayer, which manages audio sources and related functionalities. Additionally, it includes Koe, similar to `@discordjs/voice`, facilitating connections with Discord for audio transmission.
